== About Me
I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University, advised by Professor [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/ Thorsten Joachims]. 
I am supported by Bloomberg Data Science Ph.D. Fellowship.

Previously, I received my BSc (Honors) in Mathematics from Nanyang Technological University in the beautiful Singapore. 
During my undergraduate years, I spent a summer at University of California, Berkeley and a year at the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, National University of Singapore. 
In Spring 2019, I worked as a Research Intern at the Machine Learning Group at Microsoft Research NYC, advised by Miro Dudik and Akshay Krishnamurthy.

My interest lies on machine learning methods and applications. In particular, I am interested in contextual bandits and reinforcement learning.
